## 📖 Overview

This Java-based console application serves as a central arcade hub featuring three complete, fully-functional games: **Poker**, **Monopoly**, and **Wordle**.

The project's primary objective is to demonstrate robust **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including:
* **Encapsulation**
* **Abstraction**
* **Inheritance**
* **Polymorphism**

This is achieved through a modular and scalable design, where each game is developed in separate classes and packages.

🎯 **Key Features**

**Games Included**  

| Game      | Description                 | Key Mechanics                               | Notes                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Poker     | Console-based card game    | Card dealing, player hands, gameplay loop  | Configurable settings, default or custom arguments |
| Monopoly  | Board game simulation      | Color-coded properties, board navigation  | Organized via `Board` class, ANSI color codes for visuals |
| Wordle    | Word guessing game         | Player-entered or random words, validation, restart option | Inherits logic from `Process_Wordle` |

**OOP-Based Design**  

| Principle      | Implementation                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encapsulation  | Each game manages its own input and logic internally        |
| Abstraction    | Complex operations (cards, board, word logic) hidden behind method calls |
| Inheritance    | Wordle extends `Process_Wordle` to reuse shared logic      |
| Polymorphism   | Input handling and game methods adapt based on user choices|

**Input & Menu System**  
- Centralized `Input_Handling` class validates user inputs  
- Main menu allows switching between games without restarting  
- Clear prompts for easy navigation  

**Exit System**  
- User-friendly exit option from the main menu  
- Graceful shutdown of input handler

🏗️ **OOP Concepts Applied in 8-Bit Fare**

**1. Inheritance**  
- `Game` (abstract) → `Poker`, `Monopoly`, `Wordle` (concrete classes)  
- Shared components like `Board`, `Process_Wordle`, and `MyPokerGame` inherit from base classes for reusable logic  

**2. Polymorphism**  
- Abstract/game interface methods implemented per game: `start()`, `playTurn()`, `processInput()`  
- Main menu calls methods on abstract `Game` type; runtime selects the chosen game’s implementation  
- Input handling adapts to different game rules  

**3. Encapsulation**  
- Game data (e.g., player hands, board positions, guessed words) kept private inside each class  
- Public getter/setter methods for accessing/modifying game state  
- Input_Handling class encapsulates all user input validation  

**4. Abstraction**  
- Abstract classes and interfaces hide game logic details, exposing simple methods like `start()`, `play()`, or `restart()`  
- Complex operations (card dealing, board movement, word checking) hidden behind simple method calls  
- Reusable utility packages for text styling and input management  

**5. Composition**  
- `Game` objects contain other components:  
  - `Poker` contains `Deck` and `Player` objects  
  - `Monopoly` contains `Board`, `Property`, and `Player` objects  
  - `Wordle` contains `WordList` and `PlayerGuess` objects  
- Main arcade menu combines multiple `Game` objects to provide a unified experience

## 🎮 Gameplay Guide

### Starting the Arcade

Run `java -cp out Games.ArcadeSystem`
View the central menu with choices for three games
Choose: (1) Poker, (2) Monopoly, (3) Wordle, (4) Exit

### Core Utilities and Input

Centralized Input: `Input_Handling.java` ensures all inputs are validated
Game Flow: `ArcadeSystem` manages the overall loop; individual game classes control their flow

### Game Instructions

#### 🃏 Poker Game

Flow: `MyPokerGame.play()` handles dealing, betting, and hand resolution
Configuration: Starts with default settings but accepts custom configuration

#### 🏠 Monopoly Game

Setup: Requires at least two players
Display: Property colors are shown using **ANSI color codes**
Player Turn:
( 1 ) Roll Dice - `Dice.rollDice()` is called, player moves
( 2 ) Check for Doubles - Three consecutive doubles sends player to jail
( 3 ) Bank Transaction - `Bank.java` handles all purchases, rent, and taxes
( 4 ) Monopoly Menu - Allows player to Check Stats, Upgrade Property, or End Turn

#### 🟩 Wordle Game

Starting Mode: Choose between another player entering the word or generating a random word
Logic: `Wordle` class extends `Process_Wordle` for core game logic
Continuous Play: `Verify.restartGame()` prompts player for another round

### 📊 Example Monopoly Scenario

Warrior enters Lucena Town
    └─ Encounters: Port Rat, Lucena Pirate (miniboss)

Round 1: Player Isaac vs Unowned Property
    Isaac lands on Mediterranean Avenue (Price: $60)
    
    Bank Check (in `Bank.java`): playerCanBuyProperty(Isaac, 60) -> TRUE
    
    Prompt: Buy Mediterranean Avenue for $60? (Y/N)
    User Input: Y
    
    Bank Transaction:
        playerBuyProperty(Isaac, 60):
        Isaac's Money: 1500 -> 1440
        Bank Money increases by $60
        
    [Monopoly Menu appears for player's next action...]
