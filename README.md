## 📖 Overview

**8-Bit Fare** is a console-based mini-arcade system featuring three classic-inspired games — **Poker**, **Monopoly**, and **Wordle** — all integrated into one unified Java application.  
Built with strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the project demonstrates how multiple independent games can run seamlessly inside one system using modular architecture, reusable classes, and clean code design.

The system provides:
- A centralized arcade menu  
- Independent logic per game  
- Shared utilities for input handling, animations, text styling, and clearing the screen  
- An organized, expandable structure for future game additions  

**8-Bit Fare** highlights teamwork and serves as a practical demonstration of applying OOP in real-world multi-module Java applications.

## ⭐ Key Features

### **Included Games**
| Game      | Description | Key Mechanics | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Poker     | Console card game | Dealing, betting, hand evaluation | Managed by `MyPokerGame` |
| Monopoly  | Board simulation | Dice rolls, rent, buying properties | Uses ANSI color-coded tiles |
| Wordle    | Word guessing game | Player or random secret word | Uses updated `Process_Wordle` |

---

### **OOP-Based Design**
| Principle | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Encapsulation | Game logic & data kept private in classes |
| Abstraction | Simplified game interfaces: `start()`, `play()`, etc. |
| Inheritance | `Wordle` extends `Process_Wordle`; shared game logic |
| Polymorphism | Menu loads different game types at runtime |
| Composition | Games contain objects (Deck, Board, Players, WordList) |

## 🃏 Poker Game Guide (`Poker.java`)

### Game Flow  
Managed by `MyPokerGame.play()`:

1. Ante / Initial Bet  
2. Deal Cards  
3. Player Actions (Call/Raise/Fold)  
4. Discard & Draw (if variant allows)  
5. Final Bet  
6. Showdown & Payout  

### Hand Evaluation  
`Hand.java` determines:
- Pair, Two Pair, Straight, Flush, Full House, etc.

### Player Management  
- Tracks balance, pot, winnings  
- Option to continue or return to Arcade  

---
## 🏠 Monopoly Game Guide (`Monopoly.java`)

### Turn Sequence (via `Board.playerTurn()`)
1. Roll Dice (`Dice.rollDice()`)  
2. Move Player  
3. Check for Doubles  
4. Perform Tile Action (rent, tax, buy property, draw card)  

### Bank Operations (`Bank.java`)
| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `playerCanBuyProperty()` | Check funds |
| `playerBuyProperty()` | Purchase logic |
| `playerPayRent()` | Player-to-player payment |
| `playerPayTax()` | Pay tax to bank |
| `isPlayerBankrupt()` | Player elimination |

### End Turn Menu
- Check player stats  
- Upgrade property  
- End turn

## 🟩 Wordle Game Guide (`Wordle.java`)

Now updated using the **new `Process_Wordle` file** you mentioned.

### Setup
1. Choose mode:
   - Player-entered word  
   - Random word (via `WordList`)  
2. `Process_Wordle.prepareGame()` initializes everything  

### Guessing Rules
- Must be **5 letters**
- Max **6 attempts**
- Validation via `Input_Handling`

### Feedback Colors (from new `Process_Wordle`)
| Color | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Green** | Correct letter, correct position |
| **Yellow** | Correct letter, wrong position |
| **Gray** | Letter not in word |

### Restart System
`Process_Wordle.Verify.restartGame()`  
Player chooses to retry or return to Arcade.
